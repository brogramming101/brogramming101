- 👋 Hi, I’m @brogramming101
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a better programmer than I was the day before.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the CS50x course, reading Computer Networking, and asking those in my network that are getting their CS degrees for book recommendations. 
- 📚 Technical book recommendations welcomed!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything software development related. Will dabble into interesting tech like AI/ML.
- 📫 You can reach me: { Email: jfar02213@gmail.com, Instagram: brogramming101 }
